## Bank System

<pre>- This plugin should have the following commands and a user should never have a negative balance; 
- /bal [target username] - returns the user’s balance or if the optional username argument is provided, it returns the targeted user’s balance. 
- /give <target username> <amount> - subtracts the amount argument from the user’s balance and adds that amount to the target’s balance. The amount must be positive and smaller than or equal to the maximum balance of the user. 
- /setbal <target username> <amount> - user must be an operator to use this and it sets the target’s balance to the amount passed into the amount argument. The amount must be positive. 
- /earn - adds a random amount between 1 and 5 to the user’s balance and can only be used once every minute. 
- The player's balance should be stored into a database of your choice as well as making sure it is efficiently being loaded and saved.</pre>
